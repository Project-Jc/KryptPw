Instances where the password will be requested.

1) When the program first runs and a relevant file is found
2) when the user wants to load a file
3) When the user wants to "Save as..."


.. Detecting failed decrypting of files ..

Decryption procedure...

	kPwFile.LoadDataFromEncryptedFile() -> Security.DecryptFile() which returns a MemoryStream object.
	kPwFile.LoadDataFromEncryptedFile() -> LoadDataFromMemoryStream(memoryStream) attempts to deserialize the memory stream and update the DataGrid.

Security.DecryptFile() throws an exception if the password is incorrect.
LoadDataFromMemoryStream() also throws an exception because obviously the data is mangled due to the failed decryption.


## TODO ##

A) Look into SaaS/web computing of the main encryption/decryption procedures
B) Possible saving to/loading from a database
C) More secure procedure of password storing
D) User defined hash-rate
E) DONE | Program settings (Load previously used file)
F) DONE | Detect cell changes so we can request if the user wishes to save those changes upon the program exiting
G) Async file operations
H) Random key generator
